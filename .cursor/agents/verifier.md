# Verifier

After implementation, run an independent verification pass.

## Steps

1. **Type check**: Run from the **workspace root** using `pnpm --filter`:
   - Web app: `pnpm --filter grant-web type-check`
   - API app: `pnpm --filter grant-api type-check`
   - Schema package: `pnpm --filter @grantjs/schema type-check`
   - **Do not** `cd` into a package and run `npx tsc` or `./node_modules/.bin/tsc` directly — always use `pnpm --filter` from the workspace root.
   - Report any errors with file and line.

2. **Lint**: Run `pnpm --filter <package> lint`. Report violations.

3. **Tests**: Run `pnpm --filter <package> test`. Report failures; distinguish pre-existing from new.

4. **OpenAPI sync** (if REST routes were changed):
   - Compare REST route definitions in `apps/api/src/rest/routes/` against their OpenAPI specs in `apps/api/src/rest/openapi/`.
   - Flag any route/method/param that exists in one but not the other.

5. **Layer boundary scan** (for changed files):
   - **Handlers**: should not import from `@/repositories` or `@grantjs/database` tables directly — only `@/services`, `@/lib`, and `@grantjs/schema`.
   - **Services**: should not import from `@grantjs/database` tables directly — only `@/repositories`, `@/lib`, and `@grantjs/schema`.
   - **Resolvers/Routes**: should not import from `@/services` or `@/repositories` — only call via `context.handlers`.

6. **Schema codegen freshness**: If `packages/@grantjs/schema` source files (`.graphql` schemas or operations) changed, regenerate types by running `pnpm --filter @grantjs/schema generate` **from the workspace root**. The exit code may be non-zero due to the `afterAllFileWrite` format hook, but the generated files in `src/generated/` will still be updated — verify by checking file timestamps. **Do not** try to run `graphql-codegen` directly via `npx`, `pnpm exec`, or the binary path — always use `pnpm --filter` from the workspace root.

7. **Client package (`@grantjs/client`)**:
   - If source files under `packages/@grantjs/client/src/` were changed, you **must** rebuild and test.
   - The web app imports from the **built dist** (`dist/react.mjs`, `dist/index.mjs`), not from source. Editing source files alone has no effect until the package is rebuilt.
   - **Test**: `pnpm --filter @grantjs/client test` (runs vitest in watch mode; use `test:run` for CI).
   - **Build**: `pnpm --filter @grantjs/client build` (runs `vite build`, outputs to `dist/`).
   - After building, verify the fix is present in the dist: grep for a key identifier in `packages/@grantjs/client/dist/react.mjs`.
   - Do **not** try to run vitest directly via `npx`, `pnpm exec`, or `./node_modules/.bin/vitest` from within the package directory — use `pnpm --filter` from the workspace root instead.

## Output format

Return a summary:

```
Verification results:
- Type check: PASS / FAIL (N errors)
- Lint: PASS / FAIL (N issues)
- Tests: PASS / FAIL (N failures, N pre-existing)
- OpenAPI sync: PASS / FAIL (details)
- Layer boundaries: PASS / FAIL (details)
- Codegen freshness: PASS / SKIP / STALE
- Client package: PASS / SKIP / FAIL (tests N passed, dist rebuilt: yes/no)
```

If everything passes, confirm with "All checks passed."
If any check fails, list the specific issues so the parent agent or user can address them.
