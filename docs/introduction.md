# What is Grant Platform?

Grant Platform is an open-source, multi-tenant RBAC/ACL (Role-Based Access Control / Access Control List) platform designed to provide comprehensive identity and access management for modern applications.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Multi-Tenant RBAC/ACL

- **Account-based multi-tenancy** with organization and project isolation
- **Flexible permission system** with action-based scoping
- **Role and group management** with inheritance and delegation
- **Real-time permission updates** across all connected systems

### 🏗️ Modern Architecture

- **Monorepo structure** with shared packages and independent apps
- **GraphQL API** with type-safe operations and subscriptions
- **PostgreSQL database** with Drizzle ORM and migrations
- **Containerized deployment** with Docker and AWS CloudFormation

### 🚀 Developer Experience

- **TypeScript-first** with full type safety
- **Comprehensive SDK** for Node.js, Express, Next.js, and more
- **Rich documentation** with examples and best practices
- **Active community** with Discord support and GitHub discussions

### 🌐 Deployment Options

- **Self-hosting** with CloudFormation templates
- **SaaS platform** with managed infrastructure
- **Docker containers** for easy deployment
- **AWS integration** with auto-scaling and monitoring

## Use Cases

### Internal RBAC

Manage employee access to internal systems, applications, and resources with fine-grained permissions and audit trails.

### Customer Portals

Provide secure, role-based access to customer-facing applications with organization and project-level isolation.

### API Access Control

Control access to your APIs with rate limiting, permission-based endpoints, and comprehensive audit logging.

### Compliance & Auditing

Meet compliance requirements with detailed audit logs, permission tracking, and data access monitoring.

## System Architecture

Grant Platform follows a modern, scalable architecture designed for multi-tenancy and high performance:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Applications"
        Web[Web App]
        Mobile[Mobile App]
        API_Client[API Client]
    end

    subgraph "Grant Platform"
        Gateway[API Gateway]
        Auth[Authentication Service]
        RBAC[RBAC Engine]
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    end

    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        AWS[AWS Cloud]
        Docker[Docker Containers]
        CF[CloudFormation]
    end

    Web --> Gateway
    Mobile --> Gateway
    API_Client --> Gateway

    Gateway --> Auth
    Gateway --> RBAC
    Auth --> DB
    RBAC --> DB

    Gateway --> AWS
    Auth --> Docker
    RBAC --> Docker
    DB --> AWS
```

## Multi-Tenancy Model

Our account-based multi-tenancy ensures complete isolation between organizations:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Account: Acme Corp"
        A1[Organization A]
        A2[Project Alpha]
        A3[Project Beta]
        A4[Users A1-A10]
    end

    subgraph "Account: Beta Inc"
        B1[Organization B]
        B2[Project Gamma]
        B3[Project Delta]
        B4[Users B1-B15]
    end

    A1 --> A2
    A1 --> A3
    A2 --> A4
    A3 --> A4

    B1 --> B2
    B1 --> B3
    B2 --> B4
    B3 --> B4

    A1 -.->|Isolated| B1
    A2 -.->|Isolated| B2
    A4 -.->|Isolated| B4
```

## Permission Flow

Here's how permissions are evaluated in Grant Platform:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User Request]) --> Auth{Authenticated?}
    Auth -->|No| Deny[Access Denied]
    Auth -->|Yes| CheckRole{Has Role?}
    CheckRole -->|No| Deny
    CheckRole -->|Yes| CheckPerm{Has Permission?}
    CheckPerm -->|No| Deny
    CheckPerm -->|Yes| CheckScope{In Scope?}
    CheckScope -->|No| Deny
    CheckScope -->|Yes| Allow[Access Granted]

    style Start stroke:#2563eb,stroke-width:3px
    style Allow stroke:#10b981,stroke-width:2px
    style Deny stroke:#ef4444,stroke-width:2px
```
