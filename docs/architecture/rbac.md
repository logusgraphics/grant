# RBAC Model

Grant uses multi-tenant RBAC: **roles** are assigned to users in a scope (account or organization), **groups** link roles to **permissions**, and permissions grant **actions** on **resources**.

## Overview

**Account-level:** Personal Account Owner, Organization Account Owner (full control over that account).

**Organization-level:** Organization Owner, Admin, Dev, Viewer — full control down to read-only within the organization.

::: details Scope of this doc
This page covers **authorization** (which actions need which permissions). These need only **authentication** (logged in), not authorization: login/register, session management, password reset, email verification, profile picture upload, session revocation, auth method management (create/delete/set-primary/change-password).
:::

## Resources and Actions

Actions that require authorization: **read** (single resource by ID), **query** (list/collection). Some resources expose only `query` (e.g. Project, Role, Tag, API Key); others support both `read` and `query`.

::: details Which resources have read vs query only

- **Both read + query:** User, Account, Organization, Organization Member, Organization Invitation, Project User, User Session, User Authentication Method
- **Query only:** Project, Project App, Resource, Role, Group, Permission, Tag, API Key (list with optional `ids` filter)

## Roles

### Account-Level

Two account types: **personal** (one per user) and **organization** (owned by users). Each has a single role: **Personal Account Owner** or **Organization Account Owner** — full control over that account. Account ownership is independent of organization membership (you can be account owner and also Org Admin/Dev/Viewer elsewhere).

### Organization-Level

Within an organization, four roles: **Owner** (full control), **Admin** (teams and permissions, no account ownership), **Dev** (create/manage resources, roles, permissions), **Viewer** (read-only).

### Project-Level: Two Kinds of Users

- **Platform users** — People with a Grant account (personal or org member). They use the dashboard to design auth. Their project access is **inherited**: account owner → Owner on account projects; org role (Owner/Admin/Dev/Viewer) applies to org projects. The platform does not define project-level groups for them.
- **Project users** — Third-party identities in a project (Project User resource). They use the project's APIs/apps (API keys, OAuth), not the dashboard. Platform users define **custom** roles, groups, and permissions inside the project for these users; the platform supplies the primitives but not a fixed structure.

## Groups

Groups link **roles** to **permissions** via a **Role + Resource** combination. Naming: `{Resource} {Role}` (e.g. "Organization Owner", "User Dev"). Permissions live in groups; roles get access by being assigned groups.

**Flow:** `User → Role → Group → Permission → Resource`. The system evaluates all role–group combinations for the user when checking access.

::: details Standard account- and organization-level groups (reference)
**Account-level:** Only Owner groups — `Personal Account Owner`, `Organization Account Owner` (Role: Owner, Resource: Account). **Organization-level:** All four — `Organization Owner`, `Organization Admin`, `Organization Dev`, `Organization Viewer`. **Project-level:** No standard groups; platform users' project access is inherited from org role; custom project groups are user-defined.
:::

## Permission Mapping to Groups

**Common groups** — assigned to all roles (basic read/query, some create). **Role-specific groups** — extra permissions for Owner, Admin, Dev, or Viewer. Summary: Tags are Owner-only; API Key delete/revoke for Dev is own-keys only (condition). Expand below for full reference.

#### Project App Groups

Project App (Apps) are OAuth/consent applications scoped to a project. Account owners get full app management via `Account Project App Owner`; organization roles get app management via Project App Owner/Admin/Dev. There is no Project App Common group — only these role-specific groups grant access.

:::

## Naming and Scope

**Permissions** are stored as `action` (kebab-case: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `query`, `export-data`, `remove`, `revoke`, `resend-email`, `renew`, `exchange`) plus `resourceId` (references the `resources` table). **Scopes:** Account (account-level actions), Organization (org and members), Project (project resources). Access is limited to resources in the user's assigned scopes.

## Implementation Notes

**Role hierarchy (conceptual):** Owner ⊃ Admin ⊃ Dev ⊃ Viewer; only Tags are Owner-only (Admin has no tag write). **Self-management (conditions):** Dev can update own user; all users can read own sessions and auth methods; Dev can delete/revoke own API keys. See [Permission Conditions](/core-concepts/permission-conditions) for syntax. **Auth-only (no RBAC):** Login, register, session refresh, password reset, profile picture, session revocation, auth method CRUD — require only authentication.

::: details Permission evaluation steps

1. Get user's roles in the scope (account/org/project). 2. For each role, get assigned groups. 3. For each group, get permissions. 4. Build all role–group combinations. 5. Match requested action + resource to any permission. 6. If permission has a condition, evaluate with execution context. 7. Enforce tenant isolation (resource in user's scope). Flow: `User → Roles → Groups → Permissions → Resource + Action`. Conditions: [Permission Conditions](/core-concepts/permission-conditions).
