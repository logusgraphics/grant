# RBAC Model

This document provides a complete mapping of resources, actions, and role-based permissions for Grant, following standard RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) principles.

## Overview

Grant implements a multi-tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with standard roles at different tenant levels:

**Account-Level Roles:**

- **Personal Account Owner** - Full control over personal account and resources
- **Organization Account Owner** - Full control over organization account and resources

**Organization-Level Roles:**

- **Organization Owner** - Full system control within organization scope
- **Organization Admin** - Administrative access to organizations and projects
- **Organization Dev** - Developer access with ability to create and manage resources
- **Organization Viewer** - Read-only access for viewing resources and configurations

## Authentication vs Authorization

This document covers **authorization** (what actions require specific permissions). The following operations only require **authentication** (being logged in) and are NOT covered here:

- Login, registration, session management
- Password reset and email verification
- User profile picture upload
- User session revocation
- Authentication method management (create, delete, set-primary, change-password)

## Step 1: Resources and Actions

The following tables identify all resources in the Grant and the actions that **require authorization**.

### Action Definitions

- **`read`**: Permission to access a single resource by ID (e.g., `GET /users/:id`)
- **`query`**: Permission to access a list/collection of resources (e.g., `GET /users`)

**Note**: Not all resources have both actions:

- Resources with individual read endpoints: User, Account, Organization, Organization Member, Organization Invitation, Project User, User Session, User Authentication Method
- Resources with only query endpoints: Project, Resource, Role, Group, Permission, Tag, API Key (accessed via list queries with optional `ids` filter)

### Core Resources

| Resource         | Actions                                                      | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**         | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `query`, `export-data` | Individual users who can access the platform                                                |
| **Account**      | `read`, `delete`, `query`                                    | Person-centric identities that can own organizations                                        |
| **Organization** | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                | Business entities that contain projects and users                                           |
| **Project**      | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Isolated environments for managing external system identities (no individual read endpoint) |
| **Resource**     | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Domain entities defined by external systems (no individual read endpoint)                   |
| **Role**         | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Named collections of permissions (no individual read endpoint)                              |
| **Group**        | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Collections of permissions that can be assigned to roles (no individual read endpoint)      |
| **Permission**   | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Specific actions that can be performed on resources (no individual read endpoint)           |
| **Tag**          | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `query`                        | Flexible labeling system for categorization (no individual read endpoint)                   |
| **API Key**      | `create`, `delete`, `query`, `revoke`, `exchange`            | API authentication credentials for programmatic access (no individual read endpoint)        |

### Relationship Resources

| Resource                    | Actions                                                      | Description                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization Member**     | `read`, `update`, `remove`, `query`                          | Users belonging to an organization          |
| **Organization Invitation** | `create`, `read`, `query`, `revoke`, `resend-email`, `renew` | Invitations for users to join organizations |
| **Project User**            | `read`, `query`                                              | Users belonging to a project                |

### Session & Authentication Resources (Authorization-Required Actions Only)

| Resource                       | Actions         | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Session**               | `read`, `query` | Active user sessions (read-only via authorization)   |
| **User Authentication Method** | `read`, `query` | Authentication methods (read-only via authorization) |

## Step 2: Roles Based on Job Functions

Grant defines roles at different tenant levels, aligned with common job functions:

### Account-Level Roles

Accounts represent a person's identity on the platform and come in two types:

#### Personal Account

- Represents an individual user's personal workspace
- Each user can have one personal account
- Type: `personal`

#### Organization Account

- Represents an organization's workspace
- Users can own organization accounts
- Type: `organization`

**Account Owner Roles**:

- **Personal Account Owner**: Full control over personal account and all its resources
  - **Use Case**: Individual users managing their personal workspace
  - **Scope**: Account-level (personal account only)
- **Organization Account Owner**: Full control over organization account and all its resources
  - **Use Case**: Organization owners managing their organization workspace
  - **Scope**: Account-level (organization account only)

**Important**: Account ownership is separate from organization ownership. A user can be:

- Owner of their personal account (Personal Account Owner)
- Owner of an organization account (Organization Account Owner)
- Member of organizations with different roles (Organization Owner, Admin, Dev, Viewer)

### Organization-Level Roles

These roles apply within an organization scope:

#### Organization Owner

**Purpose**: Full control over organization and all resources
**Use Case**: Organization owners who need complete control over their organization, projects, and all resources
**Scope**: Organization-level

#### Organization Admin

**Purpose**: Administrative access to organizations and projects
**Use Case**: Organization administrators who manage teams, users, and permissions but don't own the organization account
**Scope**: Organization-level

#### Organization Dev

**Purpose**: Developer access with resource management capabilities
**Use Case**: Developers who need to create and manage resources, roles, and permissions for application development
**Scope**: Organization-level

#### Organization Viewer

**Purpose**: Read-only access for monitoring and auditing
**Use Case**: Stakeholders, auditors, or team members who need visibility without modification rights
**Scope**: Organization-level

### Project-Level Role Inheritance

Projects do not have their own standard roles or groups. Instead, a user's effective role within a project is inherited from their organization membership:

- **Account Projects**: The account owner always has the Owner role.
- **Organization Projects**: The user's organization role applies (Owner → Owner, Admin → Admin, Dev → Dev, Viewer → Viewer).

Users can define their own roles, groups, permissions, resources, API keys, and signing keys inside projects. The platform provides the RBAC primitives but does not prescribe a fixed project-level structure.

## Step 2.5: Groups - Role + Resource Combinations

Groups serve as the bridge between roles and permissions. They are defined as **Role + Resource combinations** to create a clear mapping structure.

### Group Naming Convention

Groups follow the pattern: `{Role} {Resource}` (e.g., "Organization Owner", "Organization Dev", "Personal Account Owner")

### Standard Groups

Groups are created by combining each role with each resource type, following business criteria for each tenant level:

#### Business Criteria for Groups

**Account-Level**:

- **Only Account Owner groups exist** - Accounts have a single role (Owner) with full access
- Two account types: Personal Account Owner, Organization Account Owner
- Rationale: Each platform user has 1-2 accounts at most, and account access is not shared

**Organization-Level**:

- **All four role groups exist** - Organization members are invited with specific roles
- Rationale: Members can have different roles (Owner, Admin, Dev, Viewer) within the same organization
- Permissions are based on the role assigned during invitation

**Project-Level**:

- The platform does **not** ship standard project-level groups. Project authorization is inherited from the user's organization-level role (see [Project-Level Role Inheritance](#project-level-role-inheritance) below).
- Users can create their own groups, roles, permissions, resources, API keys, and signing keys within projects, but these are user-defined — the platform is not opinionated about project-level structure.

#### Account-Level Groups

| Group Name                   | Role  | Resource | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Personal Account Owner`     | Owner | Account  | Full control over personal account and all resources     |
| `Organization Account Owner` | Owner | Account  | Full control over organization account and all resources |

#### Organization-Level Groups

| Group Name            | Role   | Resource     | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Organization Owner`  | Owner  | Organization | Full control over organization and resources |
| `Organization Admin`  | Admin  | Organization | Administrative access to organization        |
| `Organization Dev`    | Dev    | Organization | Developer access to organization resources   |
| `Organization Viewer` | Viewer | Organization | Read-only access to organization resources   |

### Group Structure

The permission flow follows this hierarchy:

```
User → Role → Group → Permission → Resource
```

**Example Flow:**

1. User is assigned the **Organization Owner** role in an Organization scope
2. The **Organization Owner** role is linked to multiple groups (e.g., "Organization Owner", "User Owner", "Resource Owner")
3. Each group contains specific permissions (e.g., "Organization Owner" group contains `update`, `delete` permissions for the Organization resource)
4. When evaluating access, the system checks all role-group combinations for the user

## Step 3: Permission Mapping to Groups

Permissions are assigned to groups, which are then assigned to roles. This creates a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Permissions** define what actions can be performed on resources
2. **Groups** collect related permissions for a role-resource combination
3. **Roles** are assigned groups to grant users the appropriate permissions

### Group Categories

Groups fall into two categories:

1. **Common Groups**: Contain permissions available to all authenticated users (all roles)
2. **Role-Specific Groups**: Contain permissions specific to certain roles (Owner, Admin, Dev, Viewer)

### Common Groups (All Roles)

These groups are assigned to all roles, providing basic authenticated user permissions:

| Group Name                          | Resource                   | Permissions                  | Description                                                                   |

| ------- | ---------------------------- | :-------: |
| `read`  | `user-authentication-method` |   ✅\*    |
| `query` | `user-authentication-method` |   ✅\*    |

\* Users can only read/query their own authentication methods (enforced by condition)

## Permission Naming Convention

Permissions are stored with separate `action` and `resourceId` columns in the database:

- **Action**: The operation being performed in kebab-case (e.g., `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `query`, `export-data`)
- **ResourceId**: The ID of the resource entity being acted upon (references the `resources` table)

### Action Format

All actions use kebab-case naming:

- `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `query` - Standard CRUD operations
- `export-data` - Export user data (GDPR compliance)
- `renew` - Renew organization invitation
- `remove` - Remove organization member
- `revoke`, `resend-email` - Organization invitation operations
- `revoke`, `exchange` - API key operations

### Resource Identification

Resources are identified by their ID in the `resources` table. The resource name/slug (e.g., `user`, `project`, `organization`) is stored in the `resources` table and referenced via `resourceId` in the `permissions` table.

Examples:

- `action: create`, `resourceId: <user-resource-id>` - Permission to create users
- `action: query`, `resourceId: <project-resource-id>` - Permission to query projects
- `action: remove`, `resourceId: <organization-member-resource-id>` - Permission to remove organization members

## Multi-Tenant Scope

All permissions are evaluated within the context of the multi-tenant scope:

- **Account Scope**: Actions affecting the account level (account read, deletion)
- **Organization Scope**: Actions within an organization (organization management, members, invitations)
- **Project Scope**: Actions within a project (project resources, roles, permissions)

Users can only perform actions on resources within their accessible scopes based on their role assignments.

## Implementation Notes

### Role Hierarchy

While Grant currently implements a flat role model, the permission mapping above follows a hierarchical pattern where:

- **Owner** has all permissions (superset of Admin)
- **Admin** has administrative permissions (superset of Dev, except for Tags)
- **Dev** has development permissions (superset of Viewer)
- **Viewer** has read-only permissions

### Self-Management Permissions

Certain permissions are scoped to self-management via conditions:

- Developers can update their own user profile (`update` action on `user` resource with condition)
- Users can read their own sessions (`read`, `query` actions on `user-session` resource with condition)
- Users can read their own authentication methods (`read`, `query` actions on `user-authentication-method` resource with condition)
- Developers can manage their own API keys (`delete`, `revoke` actions on `api-key` resource with condition)

### Authentication-Only Operations (No Authorization Required)

The following operations only require authentication and are handled separately from the RBAC system:

- **User Profile Picture**: Upload own profile picture
- **User Session Management**: Revoke own sessions
- **Authentication Methods**: Create, delete, set-primary, change-password for own methods
- **Auth Operations**: Login, register, refresh-session, verify-email, resend-verification, request-password-reset, reset-password, me

### Permission Evaluation

When evaluating permissions, the system follows this flow:

1. **Get User Roles**: Retrieve all roles assigned to the user in the appropriate scope (account/organization/project)
2. **Get Role Groups**: For each role, retrieve all groups assigned to that role (e.g., "Organization Owner", "User Admin", "Resource Dev")
3. **Get Group Permissions**: For each group, retrieve all permissions assigned to that group
4. **Generate Combinations**: Create all possible role-group combinations for the user
5. **Match Permissions**: Check if any permission matches the requested action and resource
6. **Evaluate Conditions**: If a matching permission has a condition, evaluate it with the execution context (user metadata, resource data, etc.)
7. **Enforce Isolation**: Enforce multi-tenant isolation (users can only access resources within their accessible scopes)

**Evaluation Flow:**

```
User → [Role1, Role2, ...] → [Group1, Group2, ...] → [Permission1, Permission2, ...] → Resource + Action
```

**Key Points:**

- The system evaluates **all role-group combinations** for a user, ensuring comprehensive permission checking
- Conditions are evaluated with execution context (user metadata, resource data) provided at evaluation time
- Permissions without conditions are granted immediately if matched
- Permissions with conditions must pass condition evaluation before access is granted

## Implementation Status

✅ **All permission guards have been implemented** across the Grant web application. All UI components that interact with protected GraphQL operations now use the `useGrant` hook from `@grantjs/client` to conditionally render based on user permissions.

**Key Implementation Details**:

- All query hooks in viewer components are guarded
- All mutation hooks in action components and dialogs are guarded
- User detail page features (image upload, name editing, role/tag management) are properly guarded
- Role hierarchy validation is enforced both in frontend and backend
- Project-scoped resources use `useScopeFromParams()` for correct tenant type detection
