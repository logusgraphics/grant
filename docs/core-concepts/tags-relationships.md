# Tags & Relationships

Tags are a generic labeling system that lets you categorize and filter entities across your projects. Each tag has a `name` and a `color`, and can be attached to any taggable entity.

## Taggable Entities

Tags can be applied to the following entities via dedicated pivot tables:

| Entity           | Pivot service             | Example use                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resource**     | `IResourceTagService`     | Group related resources (e.g. "billing", "auth") |
| **User**         | `IUserTagService`         | Label users by team or department                |
| **Role**         | `IRoleTagService`         | Categorize custom roles                          |
| **Group**        | `IGroupTagService`        | Organize permission groups                       |
| **Permission**   | `IPermissionTagService`   | Tag permissions by domain                        |
| **Organization** | `IOrganizationTagService` | Classify organizations                           |
| **Project**      | `IProjectTagService`      | Label projects by environment or purpose         |
| **Project App**  | `IProjectAppTagService`   | Label apps by purpose or environment             |
| **Account**      | `IAccountTagService`      | Tag accounts                                     |

Each pivot relationship supports an optional `isPrimary` flag to designate a primary tag per entity.

## Scope Behavior

Tags follow the same tenant scoping rules as all other entities:

- A tag created in an **Account** scope is only visible within that account
- A tag created in an **Organization** scope is only visible within that organization
- A tag created in a **Project** scope (either `AccountProject` or `OrganizationProject`) is only visible within that project

When a tag is deleted, it is automatically removed from all entity pivot tables within the scope in a single transaction.

## Intersection Filtering

All entity queries that support tags use **intersection filtering** — when you provide multiple `tagIds`, only entities that have **all** specified tags are returned.

```
GET /resources?tagIds=tag-1,tag-2,tag-3
```

This is equivalent to an AND filter: return resources tagged with `tag-1` AND `tag-2` AND `tag-3`. The intersection is computed at the pivot table level before the main entity query runs, keeping the operation efficient.

## CRUD Operations

Tags support standard CRUD via GraphQL mutations:

| Operation | Mutation     | Permission   |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Create    | `createTag`  | `Tag:Create` |
| Update    | `updateTag`  | `Tag:Update` |
| Delete    | `deleteTag`  | `Tag:Delete` |
| List      | `tags` query | `Tag:Query`  |

Attaching and detaching tags from entities is handled through entity-specific mutations (e.g. adding a tag to a resource is part of the resource mutation flow, not the tag mutation flow).

## Tag color palette

Tag colors are defined in `@grantjs/constants` and must be **perceptually distinct**. We use the **CIEDE2000 (ΔE00)** metric in LAB space, comparing each color at **Tailwind shade 500**. Every pair of palette colors must have ΔE00 ≥ `MIN_PALETTE_DELTA_E` (see `packages/@grantjs/constants/src/colors.ts`). This avoids ambiguous choices (e.g. multiple near-identical grays). The palette check is enforced in CI via `pnpm --filter @grantjs/constants run check:palette`. When adding or changing tag colors, ensure the script passes.

## CDM lifecycle for tags

Project permission CDM (canonical data model) sync supports tags as a first-class section. When a CDM artifact is imported into a project (`POST /api/projects/:id/permissions/sync-jobs`) or exported from one (`GET /api/projects/:id/permissions/export?sections=tags,…`), the platform round-trips:

- the `tags` section — project-visible tag definitions plus `project_tags` membership rows,
- `tagKeys` / `groupTagKeys` on each `roleTemplates[i]` — `role_tags` and `group_tags` associations for the role's auto-created CDM group,
- `tagKeys` on each `userAssignments[i]` — global `user_tags` rows for the assigned user.

### CDM identity envelope

Tag rows created by CDM sync carry a reserved `metadata.cdmImport` envelope:

```json
{
  "cdmImport": {
    "projectId": "<importing project>",
    "kind": "tag",
    "externalKey": "<TagCdmInput.externalKey>"
  },
  "cdmSource": { "...": "importer-supplied JSON" }
}
```

Only rows with this envelope are torn down on re-import. User-created tags (created via `createTag` GraphQL mutation or the UI) never carry `cdmImport` and are therefore never touched by CDM sync, including its replace-import sweep.

### Project membership creation

The CDM `tags` section creates membership in the importing project via `project_tags`. A tag entry that you import into project `A` is not automatically visible in project `B`; the CDM artifact is the unit of project membership. Re-importing the same artifact into a second project would create a second CDM-marked tag row (parallel to how role templates work today).

### Cross-project effect of `user_tags`

`user_tags` rows are global — Grant attaches them to the user, not the project. Re-importing an artifact whose `userAssignments[i].tagKeys` references a tag created in this project will:

- create the global `user_tags` row, and
- make that tag visible on the user across **every** project the user belongs to.

This is the same behaviour as direct user mutations through the API; CDM sync does not gate it. The export dialog and OpenAPI description both warn about this trade-off, but the contract is explicit: opt in by including the `tags` and `userAssignments` sections together.

### Teardown semantics

`TagHandler.teardown` runs at order 5, before `RoleTemplateHandler` (10) and `UserAssignmentHandler` (20), and:

1. lists every tag whose `metadata.cdmImport.projectId` matches the importing project;
2. soft-deletes those tag rows **and** their pivot rows in `project_tags`, `role_tags`, `group_tags`, and `user_tags` in a single batch (soft-delete cascades do not fire on the FK side, so the pivots must be removed explicitly).

Plain user-created tags are never affected, even if they share a name or color with a CDM-imported tag.
