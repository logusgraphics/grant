 * key. The original Grant ids ride along under `metadata.cdmSource` for
 * traceability — but they never appear as identity in cross-references.
 *
 * We use a short, hex-encoded SHA-256 prefix joined with the entity kind so:
 *   - keys are deterministic across re-exports of the same row,
 *   - keys are globally unique within a CDM document (including the kind
 *     prefix prevents accidental cross-kind collisions),
 *   - keys are obviously not UUIDs (so accidental round-trip leaks of Grant
 *     ids are easy to spot in tests and audits).
