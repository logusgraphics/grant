-- RLS: Create restricted role for tenant-scoped request isolation.
-- The app login role (table owner) bypasses RLS by default in PostgreSQL.
-- Scoped requests SET LOCAL ROLE to this restricted role inside a transaction,
-- which makes RLS policies on pivot tables apply.
-- System operations and background jobs never switch role, so they bypass RLS naturally.
